/** Advanced datastax driver configuration
  *
  * @param connection
  *   Configures query connection.
  * @param reconnectOnInit
  *   Whether to schedule reconnection attempts if all contact points are unreachable on the first initialization attempt.
  *
  * If this is true, the driver will retry according to the reconnection policy. The `SessionBuilder.build()` call -- or the future returned
  * by `SessionBuilder.buildAsync()` -- won't complete until a contact point has been reached.
  *
  * If this is false and no contact points are available, the driver will fail.
  * @param reconnectionPolicy
  *   The policy that controls how often the driver tries to re-establish connections to down nodes.
  * @param retryPolicy
  *   The policy that controls if the driver retries requests that have failed on one node.
  * @param speculativeExecutionPolicy
  *   The policy that controls if the driver pre-emptively tries other nodes if a node takes too long to respond.
  * @param authProvider
  *   if `None` no authentication will occur.
  * @param timestampGenerator
  *   The generator that assigns a microsecond timestamp to each request.
  * @param requestTracker
  *   A session-wide component that tracks the outcome of requests. By default
  *   `com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.trackerNoopRequestTracker` is used.
  * @param throttler
  *   A session-wide component that controls the rate at which requests are executed. By default `PassThroughRequestThrottler` is used.
  * @param nodeStateListener
  *   A session-wide component that listens for node state changes. By default
  *   `com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.metadata.NoopNodeStateListener` is used.
  * @param schemaChangeListener
  *   A session-wide component that listens for node state changes. By default
  *   `com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.metadata.schema.NoopSchemaChangeListener` is used.
  * @param addressTranslator
  *   The address translator to use to convert the addresses sent by Cassandra nodes into ones that the driver uses to connect. By default
  *   `com.datastax.oss.driver.internal.core.addresstranslation.PassThroughAddressTranslator` is used.
  * @param resolveContactPoints
  *   Whether to resolve the addresses passed to `Basic.contactPoints`.
  *
  * If this is true, addresses are created with `InetSocketAddress(String, int)`: the host name will be resolved the first time, and the
  * driver will use the resolved IP address for all subsequent connection attempts.
  *
  * If this is false, addresses are created with `InetSocketAddress.createUnresolved()`: the host name will be resolved again every time the
  * driver opens a new connection. This is useful for containerized environments where DNS records are more likely to change over time (note
  * that the JVM and OS have their own DNS caching mechanisms, so you might need additional configuration beyond the driver).
  * @param protocol
  *   The native protocol to use which defines the format of the binary messages between driver and Cassandra.
  * @param request
  *   Request configuration.
  * @param metrics
  *   Metrics configuration. Disabled by default.
  * @param heartbeat
  *   Heartbeat configuration to check if node is alive.
  * @param socket
  *   Socket configuration.
  * @param metadata
  *   Metadata about the Cassandra cluster.
  * @param controlConnection
  *   Configures dedicated administrative connection.
  * @param preparedStatements
  *   Prepared statements configuration.
  * @param netty
  *   Netty configuration which is used internally by driver.
  * @param coalescer
  *   The component that coalesces writes on the connections.

  * penalty (one extra roundtrip to resend the query to prepare, and another to retry the execution).

  * Checking the table first avoids repreparing unnecessarily, but the cost of the query is not always worth the improvement, especially if
